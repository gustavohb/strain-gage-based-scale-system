# Strain Gage-based Scale System

The software interface for the strain gage-based scale system was written as part of a summer project at the Montana State University, Bozeman.

The primary requeriment of the interface was to provide real time readout of the load applied in grams.


## About

This project uses an Arduino Uno board to sample the load data and communicate with the MATLAB via USB.


### What has been implemented:

* Automate the process of taking and displaying weigh measures.
* Demonstrate the changes in the system performance by
adjusting the parameters of the sensor signal conditioning
circuits.
* Allow various interactive post signal processing, such as standard deviations and histogram.
